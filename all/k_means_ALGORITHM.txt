Algorithm for K-Means Clustering
1.Initialize Parameters:

Set the number of clusters 
ùëò
k and the maximum number of iterations.

2.Load Data:

Read data points from a file (e.g., sample_data.txt) into a list of points.


3.Initialize Centroids:
Randomly select k  data points from the dataset as initial centroids.

4.Iterate for a Fixed Number of Iterations (or until convergence):

For each iteration:
1.Assign Clusters:
For each data point:
Calculate the Euclidean distance from the point to each centroid.
Assign the point to the cluster corresponding to the nearest centroid.
2.Update Centroids:
For each cluster:
Calculate the new centroid by finding the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.
If a cluster has no points assigned, retain its previous centroid.

5.Output Results:

After completing the iterations, output the final centroids of each cluster
